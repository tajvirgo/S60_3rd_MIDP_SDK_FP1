           This example demonstrates both &nbsp;JSR 75 file connection and
 JSR  135 Mobile Media API. &nbsp;The application displays MIDI (.mid) files
 available  on the device file system and allows the user to play them.<br>

  <p>The example is built using the standard method for building and running 
    as described in 				<a
 href="../../../../../../../../doc-files/building.html">Building  and running
 the examples</a>.<br>
      </p>
               
  <p>In order to play a MIDI file you must place the file in the appropriate
 directory  for your MIDP SDK. 
           
  <p>When the midlet starts the user is prompted to accept the read data operation
and the following screen appears.<br>

     <br>
     </p>
           
  <p>Screens similar to the above screen will appear when operations access 
 the file system. &nbsp;Once the midlet has read the contents of the music 
 folder a spash screen will appear as shown below.<br>
     </p>
           
  <p><img src="doc-files/image2.jpg" alt="image 2" width="182"
 height="211">
     <br>
     </p>
           
  <p>Any key press will advance the midlet to the next screen that displays 
 the contents of the music directory.<br>

  <p>Selecting the options will cause the following pop up screen to appear.<br>

     </p>
           
  <p>This allows playing or deleting the currently selected file. &nbsp;The 
 user may also access an about info box or exit the meidlet from this screen. 
 &nbsp;When a MIDI file is playing the Play option on the screen above is 
changed to a Stop option.<br>
     </p>
           
  <p>Here are two screen shots that display the about info screen.<br>

  <p>The FileConnectionDemo class is the midlet class for this example. &nbsp;The
  FileSelector class provides most of the application functionality by making
  use of the services provided by the JSR 135 Player class and the JSR 75
FileConnection  class. &nbsp;The example also has two classes derived from
the Alert class  for part of the user interface.</p>
