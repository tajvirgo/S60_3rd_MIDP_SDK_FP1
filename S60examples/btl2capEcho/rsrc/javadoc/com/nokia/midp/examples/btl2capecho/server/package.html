<h3> <a name="1">1. About this example</a> </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> This is the server portion of the Bluetooth L2CAP example.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> <a name="2">2. Pre-requisites</a> </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The example makes use of the standard MIDP application framework
and LCDUI API. The reader should be familiar with these areas before
attempting to understand this example.</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3> <a name="3">3. Building and running</a> </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The example is built using the standard method for building and
running as described in <a
 href="../../../../../../../../../doc-files/building.html">Building and
running the examples</a>.&nbsp; In order to run the Bluetooth L2CAP client 
and server on&nbsp; SDK, the client midlet and server midlet need to be 
installed in seperate SDK on seperate desktop, and a casira-box can be used
to set up the bluetooth communication in between two SDKs.&nbsp; 
The following are the instructions for configurating casira-box.<br>
On the PC:<br>
1) connect it to the serial port on the PC (NOT THE USB)<br>
2) Go into the device Manager and select Com Ports and right click for
properties.<br>
3) Select the port speed to be 115200<br>
&nbsp; <br>
On the SDK:<br>
4) Launch the SDK and go into preferences.<br>
5) in Prefs, select PAN (Personal Area Network) settings tab.<br>
6) Turn off IRDA. Turn on BT and set to BSCP and Com 1.<br>
7) restart the SDK.<br>
8) Go into the SDK communication settings for BT. Give the SDK a BT
name if it does not have one.<br>
9) Choose to turn on BT and allow others to discover it. <br>
10) Discover other devices and pair.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The following classes should be included in the jar:</p>
  <blockquote>com.nokia.midp.examples.btl2capEcho.*<br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No resource files are used in this example.<br>
  </p>
  <p><br>
When the user starts the MIDlet a the following menu screen appears.<br>
  </p>
  <p><img src="doc-files/start.jpg" alt="start screen" width="354"
 height="418"> </p>
  <p>The screen controls the client/server mode of operation, the
inquiry access code setting (general or limited) and the use of
authentication.
&nbsp;The user must select the server mode of operation before starting
the server. &nbsp;The user then starts the application. &nbsp;A search
screen
appears and the user must search for a client device. &nbsp;If a device
is found then the a connection may be opened to the device and the
following
screen appears.<br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; <img src="doc-files/run.jpg" alt="running screen"
 width="354" height="418"> <br>
  </p>
  <p>This screen displays the connection status, the send data and the
last data received from the client midlet running in another instance
of the phone.<br>

<h3> <a name="5">5. Summary</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This example illustrates the implementation of a server midlet
that makes
use of Bluetooth/L2CAP. </p>
