process</h1>
<p>Whether you are developing an enterprise-wide application or a simple
cell phone game, the cycle of debugging and testing proceeds similarly — through
successive rounds of debugging and testing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>Debugging</span></p>

<p>Wireless consumers tend to be less technically oriented than desktop
computer users and will be less tolerant when programs fail to work properly.
Thorough debugging and testing of wireless applications is extremely important.</p>
<p>A debugger systematically breaks down your code into distinct sections,
monitors the activity, and verifies that the code executes the way it was
intended. When the debugger finds an error, you correct the problem in your
source code, recompile, and resume testing.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span>Testing</span></p>

<p>Before testing on actual devices, you can test on an emulator integrated
with your development environment. By testing your MIDlets on multiple emulators,
you can get an instant sense of how your application will look and function
on the actual devices. Ultimately, of course, your wireless application should
be tested on the actual device(s) it will run on.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span>Coding Errors</span></p>

<p>Three broad categories of errors can occur in your code: compile errors,
runtime errors, and logic errors.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compile errors appear at the time your source code is compiled.
Syntax errors commonly appear at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>A runtime error causes the program to fail or terminate prematurely.
Runtime errors result from problems that will not occur until the code is
being executed. For example, trying to open a file that does not exist, or
attempting to divide by zero, are errors that cannot be caught at compile
time.</p><p>In a typical development environment, when your program
throws an exception, a debugger will print a stack trace in the Console output
view, input view, and error view. You then double-click a line of the stack
trace to go directly to the line of source code listed in the trace. As execution
proceeds, you monitor the program's behavior step by step, until the error
is produced or the program fails. At that point, you fix the bugs, recompile
the program, and resume testing.</p></li>
<li><p>A logic error is a non-fatal problem with the design or implementation
of your application. Although the program statements may not throw exceptions,
they do not produce the results you intended when you wrote the code. For
example, logic errors can occur when variables contain incorrect values, when
graphic images don't look right, or when output is simply incorrect. Memory
leaks and attempting to insert more elements into an array than were allocated
to the array can also result from logic errors.</p><p>A debugger can
help locate logic errors by allowing you to monitor the values of program
variables and data objects as the program executes. Modifying data values
during a debugging session is a good way to test hypothetical bug fixes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>Enabling optional compiler warnings in your IDE allows you to make full
use of its debugging features. However, this can considerably slow down the
process. In Eclipse, compiler warnings can be turned on or off by selecting
in the Eclipse menu bar <span>Run &gt; Debug &gt; Nokia SDK Plug-in</span> and then choosing
the appropriate warnings.</p></div>
<div><h3>Common testing programs</h3><p>The Java Verified testing program is an industry-wide initiative for
testing J2ME™ applications. In the program, applications are tested against
Unified Testing Criteria, which is developed and maintained by Unified Testing
Initiative™ launched by Motorola, Nokia, Siemens, Sony Ericsson, and Sun Microsystems.
It is recommendable to use Unified Testing Criteria (UTC) and also implement
its requirements to the applications. For more information about Java Verified,

Web site</a>.</p></div>
