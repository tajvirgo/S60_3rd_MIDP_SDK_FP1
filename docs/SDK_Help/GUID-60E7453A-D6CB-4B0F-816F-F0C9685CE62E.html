settings</h1>
<p>The following sections give information about the internal settings
supported by JSR-205.</p>
<div><h3>Maximum size of MMS</h3><p>In the S60 implementation, the maximum size for an MMS to be sent through
JSR-205 is 300K. This value is specified by <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release_program/docs/MMS/V1_2-20030923-C/OMA-MMS-CONF-V1_2-20030929-C.pdf" target="_blank">MMS Conformance Document 1.2</a>. The creation of any MMS with a size
bigger than 300K will result in a <code>SizeExceededException</code>.</p><p/></div>
<div><h3>MMS store</h3><p>In the S60 implementation, by default the MMS store is the phone memory
(C: drive), but the user can change that to be memory card. In this case,
if the memory card is removed and an MMS (or notification) arrives to the
phone, it will be saved into the phone's memory, which becomes automatically
the new MMS store.  </p><p>If the user later reinserts the memory card into the phone, the MMSs
which were received while the memory card was the MMS store will
not be available unless the user resets the memory card as the new MMS store.</p><p/></div>
<div><h3>Receiving MMS messages</h3><p>In the S60 implementation, MMSs addressed to registered Java applications
are not saved into the Inbox and are not visible through the Messaging UI.
These kinds of MMSs are only visible towards the registered Java applications. </p><p>In case there is no registered Java application for a certain received
MMS, then this MMS will be saved into the Inbox and therefore it will be visible
through Messaging UI. </p><p>The automatic/manual fetch feature of the S60 phones applies to MMSs
received by JSR-205 as well: </p><ul>
<li><p>In automatic fetching, the MMSs will be automatically fetched
(either into a specific folder if there is a registered Java application for
that MMS or into the Inbox if there is no registered Java application for
that MMS).</p></li>
<li><p>In manual fetching, a regular notification (with no Java-specific
information) about the incoming MMS will be saved into the Inbox and shown
to the phone user who can decide whether to fetch the MMS.</p></li>
</ul><p/></div>
<div><h3>Reply mechanism </h3><p>The reply mechanism defined in Appendix D of the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=205" target="_blank">JSR-205
specification</a> is supported as clarified in the paragraphs below.
The reply mechanism is based on the ‘Reply-To-Application-ID’ transport header
defined by JSR-205. The reply mechanism means sending a received message back
to the sender without specifically setting the recipient’s address (this will
be done automatically by the implementation based on the information attached
to the message to be sent. Thus, the message to be sent becomes a reply-type
of message). The reply-type of the message is a message which came from a
sender which is prepared for receiving responses to the sent message. JSR-205
specifies only how the ‘Reply-To-Application-ID’ is set on the sender side
in case of a server-type of connection (“<span>when a message identifying an
application-id is sent from a server type MessageConnection, the Reply-To-Application-ID
in the message is set to the application-id of the MessageConnection</span>”),
but JSR-205 does not specify how this header is set on the sender side in
case of a client-type of connection and how this header is used on the receiver
side. The S60 implementation for this is:</p><ul>
<li><p>In case of a client-type of connection JSR-205 mandates that
"<span>when a client type <code>MessageConnection</code> is used for
sending a message with an application-id, the 'Reply-To-Application-ID' is
set to an implementation-specific value</span>". The S60's implementation specific
value is '$'. Therefore, the S60 implementation recognizes a reply-type of
message as a message which has 'Reply-To-Application-ID' transport header
set to something else than '$'</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘Reply-To-Application-ID’ header is visible on the receiver
side via <code>getAddress()</code> or <code>getAddress("from")</code> methods.
All the other get methods for the address(es) will return the receiver’s own
application ID. In case of a non reply-type of message the implementation
returns the sender's address without the application ID.</p></li>
<li><p>The receiver makes a reply by simply sending a received message
back to the sender without specifically setting the recipient’s address (the
receiver is free to modify other fields of the message, but the addresses).
In this case the implementation checks if the message to be sent is a reply-type
of message or not (by checking the presence of the ‘Reply-To-Application-ID’
info attached to the message).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In case the message is a reply-type of message, the implementation
will discard all the other recipients of the message and it will only send
the message to original sender of the message. In the same time the ‘Reply-To-Application-ID’
header of the message to be sent as a reply is set to be the application ID
of the current sender (that is, the message which is sent as a reply is a
reply-type of message as well). After being sent, a reply-type of message
has only one “to” address set to point to the original sender of the message.
All the other addresses have been cleared after sending.</p></li>
<li><p>In case the message to be sent is not a reply-type of message,
the implementation will throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>,
informing the receiver that the message to be sent is not a reply-type of
message. </p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>On the other hand, as soon as the receiver of a reply-type
of message touched/modified some of the message’s addresses (by calling one
of the <code>setAddress()</code> or <code>removeAddress()</code> methods),
the message is not a reply-type of message anymore; by calling the <code>send()</code> method
with this kind of message, the receiver performs a simple send (to the message's
recipients) and not a reply.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div><h3>Out of memory</h3><p>In the S60 implementation, there is no difference in handling the lack
of memory scenario for MMSs addressed to Java applications and other MMSs
(going by default to the Inbox):</p><ul>
<li><p>In manual fetching: the notification about the incoming MMS
will be put to a failed state and a corresponding error code will indicate
the lack of memory </p></li>
<li><p>In automatic fetching: the terminal user will be notified
about the lack of memory and the receiving of the incoming MMS will be re-scheduled</p>
</li>
</ul><p/></div>
<div><h3>Alert tone</h3><p>When an MMS addressed to a certain Java application is received by the
phone, the same alert tone which is assigned for the receiving of MMS’s (going
by default to the Inbox) will be played/heard. </p></div>
<div><h3>Deploying push MIDlets</h3><p>In the S60 implementation, Push MIDlets should be installed in a MIDlet
suite of their own (which does not contain other MIDlets). The reason for
this is that a push MIDlet can not be restarted if a MIDlet (which was installed
from the same MIDlet suite with the push MIDlet) is running.</p><p/></div>
<div><h3>Security settings</h3><p>The Wireless Messaging API security model implemented is based on the
security requirements specified in <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=118" target="_blank">Mobile
Information Device Profile for Java 2 Micro Edition, Version 2.0</a> and <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=185" target="_blank">Java Technology for the Wireless
Industry Specification</a>. </p><p>Briefly, Wireless Messaging API is assigned to Messaging function group
with the following user permission settings/interaction modes for the <code>send()</code> method:</p><div class="tablenoborder"><a xmlns:d="http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc" name="GUID-09B29B2F-BE93-4375-9303-F9AD55BE52BF"><!----></a><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="GUID-09B29B2F-BE93-4375-9303-F9AD55BE52BF" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">

</table></div><p>In the S60 implementation, there are no user prompts for using the other
methods of Wireless Messaging API. The interaction modes, or user permission
settings, specify how to prompt the user to grant permissions to a specific
API with one of the following modes:</p><ul>
<li><p>“Blanket” is valid for every invocation of an API by a MIDlet
suite until it is uninstalled or the permission is changed by the user.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Session” is valid from the invocation of a MIDlet suite
until it terminates. “Session” mode MUST prompt the user on or before the
first invocation of the API or function which is protected. When the user
re-invokes the MIDlet suite, the prompt MUST be repeated.</p></li>
<li><p>“Oneshot” MUST prompt the user on each invocation of the
API or function which is protected.</p></li>
</ul><p>The S60 implementation shows only the number of recipients to which
the MMS is about to be sent. The size of each of the <code>MessagePart</code> can
be retrieved separately by using<code> MessagePart.getLength()</code> method.
This clarification applies to the following paragraph:</p><p><span>“An Application MUST receive a user permission to send an MMS. The
user makes a decision based on the following information provided by the application: </span></p><ul>
<li><p><span>List of all recipient addresses: all addresses set in
the "to", "cc" and "bcc" fields</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>The total size of the message, which includes the size
of all message attachments and the size of the subject.” (Appendix E, E.2.1
E.2.2 Permissions for Send and Receive Operations; <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=205" target="_blank">JSR-205
API specification</a>)</span></p></li>
