for multiple devices</h1>
<p/>
<p>Creating applications for multiple devices produce design challenges
that need to be considered at the design phase. The variations between mobile
devices mean that checking the implementation details of each device and testing
the application on all target devices is mandatory. The following is a list
of the main issues in designing for multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Differences between devices</p>

<p>Different devices run on different developer platforms that include
different APIs. Even devices that have the same APIs may have different implementations,
including whether all optional packages are implemented or whether a different
version of the API is used. </p>
<p>In addition to the different developer platforms, devices also tend
to have a variety of different screen size, memory and other qualities.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Differences between API implementations</p>

<p>Even if the devices run on the same developer platform and the same
APIs, there may be differences in the implementation of individual mobile
device models that may cause problems.  For information on all S60 devices, see
Device Specifications on the <a href="http://www.s60.com/life/s60phones" target="_blank">S60
platform Web site</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Differences between screen sizes</p>

<p>Mobile devices tend come in a variety of screen resolutions. This means
that an application is more likely to work on devices that have a matching
screen resolution to the original target device.</p>
<p>The MIDP 2.0 specification provides several properties and methods that
can be used for querying different aspects of an API implementation. The proper
use of these can make porting MIDlets much easier.</p>
<p>There are two levels of user interface components available in the LCDUI
package: high-level APIs and low-level APIs. When high-level APIs and components
are used, the MIDlet has a greater portability because logical components
are being used, that is, the MIDlet only guides the device on laying out the
components. However, even on this level, portability cannot be guaranteed.
For example, the aspects of the component layout which are not mandatory cannot
be relied to be portable.</p>
<p>With low-level APIs, the MIDlet draws directly on the screen using lower-level
primitives. One important issue concerning these low-level APIs is hard-coding
positional information in order to achieve a required layout for a device.
This can easily lead to problems as the result can look quite different on
other devices. To prevent these type of problems, MIDlets can obtain several
variables, such as the canvas or font size, from the device to avoid layout
problems. For example, it is a common fault to assume a certain font height
and then start the following line of text from a fixed distance below the
first line, which may look awkward on some devices.</p>
