Corporation End-User Software Agreement</h1>
<p>This Software Agreement ("Agreement") is between You (either an individual
or an entity), the End User, and Nokia Corporation ("Nokia"). The Agreement
authorizes You to use the Software specified in Clause 1 below, which may
be stored on a CD-ROM, sent to You by electronic mail, or downloaded from
Nokia's Web pages or Servers or from other sources under the terms and conditions
set forth below.</p>
<p>This is an agreement on end-user rights and not an agreement for sale.
Nokia continues to own the copy of the Software and the physical media contained
in the sales package and any other copy that You are authorized to make pursuant
to this Agreement. You also acknowledge that the Software contains portions
of software licensed by Symbian Software Limited whose registered office is
situated at 2-6 Boundary Row, London SE1 8HP, UK ("Symbian") or its third
party licensors and which has been licensed to Nokia under a separate agreement
between Nokia and Symbian. </p>
<p>Read this Agreement carefully before installing, downloading, or using
the Software. By clicking on the "I Accept" button while installing, downloading,
and/or using the Software, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
If You do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
promptly click the "Decline" or "I Do Not Accept" button, cancel the installation
or downloading, or destroy or return the Software and accompanying documentation
to Nokia. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT YOU HAVE
READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND
CONDITIONS. </p>

<p>As used in this Agreement, the term "Software" means, collectively:
(i) the software product identified above (ii) all the contents of the disk(s),
CD-ROM(s), electronic mail and its file attachments, or other media with which
this Agreement is provided, including the object code form of the software
delivered via a CD-ROM, electronic mail, or Web page (iii) digital images,
stock photographs, clip art, or other artistic works ("Stock Files") (iv)
related explanatory written materials and any other possible documentation
related thereto ("Documentation"); (v) fonts, and (vi) upgrades, modified
versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software (collectively "Updates"),

RIGHTS AND USE</span></p><p>Nokia grants to You non-exclusive, non-transferable
end-user rights to install the Software on the local hard disk(s) or other
permanent storage media of one computer and use the Software on a single computer
or terminal at a time.</p><p>You acknowledge that the use of the Software
may require licenses to third party patents and that Nokia does not grant
any licenses to such third party patents under this Agreement to the You.
 Also, any and all standards related licenses with respect to Essential Patents
(as defined below) are specifically excluded from the scope of this Agreement,
and those licenses need to be acquired separately from Nokia or the respective
right holders, as the case may be. “Essential Patent” means any patent claiming
a feature necessarily and unavoidably required for compliance with industry
standards (usually GSM, WCDMA or other similar mobile communications standard),
to the limited extent only that infringement or use of such claims of a patent
cannot be avoided in remaining compliant with industry standard either for
technological reasons or for lack of commercially viable technical alternatives.</p>
<p>No patent licenses to any patents of Nokia and/ or its Affiliates are
granted under this Agreement.</p></li>
