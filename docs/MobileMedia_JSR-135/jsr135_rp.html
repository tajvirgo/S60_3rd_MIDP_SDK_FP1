    <h1>Multimedia Security</h1>

    <h2>Addendum to the Mobile Media API (JSR135) version 1.2</h2>

    <p><i>
	Version 1.2  1 March 2006
      </i></p>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

<p>This document, <i>Multimedia Security</i> is an addendum to the Mobile Media API
      (JSR-135) version 1.2 for the Java TM 2 Platform. The specification is aimed
      for implementations of the Mobile Media API, with the 
      <i>Mobile Information Device Profile, Version 2.0 (JSR-118)</i> and the
      <i>Connected Device Configuration, Version 1.0 (JSR-36)</i> specification.
      The above specifications can be found at 
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/135.jsp">http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/135.jsp</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/118.jsp">http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/118.jsp</a>,
      and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/36.jsp">http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/36.jsp</a> 
      respectively.</p>
    
    <p>The terminology used herein is defined by the above specifications except where noted.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Who Should use this Document</h2>

    <p>
      The audience for
      this document is the Java Community Process (JCP) Expert Group that defined the
      Mobile Media API specifications, implementers of the MIDP or CDC/FP and the
      Mobile Media API, application developers using the MIDP or CDC/FP and the Mobile Media
      API, service providers deploying MMAPI applications, and wireless operators
      deploying the infrastructure to support MIDP and CDC/FP devices. This document
      specifically targets network operators, manufacturers, and service and
      application providers operating in GSM and UMTS networks.</p>


    <h2>Scope of this Document</h2>

    <p>
      This addendum is informative in a way that implementing profile will specify what
      security framework is used and how it is implemented. Special interest
      is on MIDP 2.0 for which it is specified that MMAPI implementations on top of
      MIDP 2.0 must follow this document.
      The behavior of the security of a MMAPI implementation for CDC is also specified.

      The purpose of this document is to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Define the security framework for Mobile Media API
      <li>
	Define the security policy identifiers for the Mobile Media API when
	used together with MIDP 2.0
      <li>
	Define the security Permissions for the Mobile Media API
	when used together with CDC 1.0 or later
    </ul>

    <h1>1. General</span></h1>

    <p>
      The Mobile Media API (MMAPI) specification does not define a security framework of its own.
      Rather, implementations of MMAPI are subject to the security mechanisms
      provided by the underlying profile and configuration, e.g. MIDP 2.0 or CDC. Some
      methods in MMAPI are defined such that a SecurityException will be thrown when
      called without the appropriate security permissions from the caller.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An implementation MUST guarantee that:      
    <ol>
      <li>
	the SecurityException is thrown when the caller does not have the appropriate
	security permissions to execute the method;
      <li>
	the method can be
	used when the appropriate permissions are granted.
    </ol>
  </p>
    
    <p>
      Access to the MMAPI properties that can be queried by 
      System.getProperty(String key) is never security constrained.
    </p>

    <h1>2. Security Concerns for Mobile Media API</h1>

    <p>
      The security concerns of the MMAPI can be divided into areas of recording, network access
      and access to local data stores. In order to perform any actions on those
      areas using MMAPI the application MUST be granted the permission to do so. The
      mechanism to grant the permission is implementation specific and not in the
      scope of this document.
    </p>

    <h2>2.1 Permissions for recording</h2>

    <p>
      Recording in MMAPI
      include recording of audio and video and capturing of still images with the
      camera. The security issue in recording is the concern about user's privacy.
      Application silently accessing recording functionality could be used e.g. to
      record and distribute private conversations of the user. Therefore methods for
      recording and image capturing must be granted the appropriate permission.</p>

    <h3>Permissions for MIDP implementations of MMAPI</h3>
    <p>MMAPI implementations on the MIDP and compatible profiles must perform
      the permission checks in these methods:</p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=0 width="100%">
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b>&nbsp;API call</b>
	</td>
	<td>
	  <b>&nbsp;Permission</b>
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  &nbsp;<code>RecordControl.setRecordLocation(String locator)</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>RecordControl.setRecordStream(OutputStream stream)</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>VideoControl.getSnapshot(String type)</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  &nbsp;<code>javax.microedition.media.control.RecordControl</code><br>
	  &nbsp;<code>javax.microedition.media.control.RecordControl</code><br>
	  &nbsp;<code>javax.microedition.media.control.VideoControl.getSnapshot</code>
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Permissions for CDC implementations of MMAPI</h3>
    <p>MMAPI implementations on configurations and profiles that use
      the fine grained security permissions based on 
      <tt>java.security.Permission</tt> security checks must include 
      the class <tt><a href=PlayerPermission.html>javax.microedition.media.PlayerPermission</a></tt>
      and the methods below must perform permission checks:</p>

    <table border=1 cellpadding=0 width="100%">
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b>&nbsp;API call</b>
	</td>
	<td>
	  <b>&nbsp;Action in javax.microedition.media.PlayerPermission</b>
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  &nbsp;<code>RecordControl.setRecordLocation(String locator)</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>RecordControl.setRecordStream(OutputStream stream)</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>VideoControl.getSnapshot(String type)</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  &nbsp;<code>"record"</code><br>
	  &nbsp;<code>"record"</code><br>
	  &nbsp;<code>"snapshot"</code>
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>2.2 Other Permissions</h2>
    
    <p>
      There are other than media recording related security issues when MMAPI is used.
      Those issues are related to accessing resources either locally or over the network.

      Media player can be initialized by a locator pointing to a content that can reside
      on a network server or it could be on some local storage. Reading data over the network
      requires use of the network connection that may have security policy in place. An access to
      a local data storage may have security policies in place as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementation of MMAPI must follow the security
      practices that are in place for accessing those resources. For example, when a Player is created to
      play content on a HTTP server, MMAPI implemented on top of MIDP 2.0 must follow the MIDP 2.0 security practices for network access.
    </p>
    <p>
      MMAPI implemented on CDC must conform to the security requirements
      of the CDC configuration.
      When a locator is used to access media the MMAPI implementation must
      throw a <tt>SecurityException</tt> under the same conditions as
      would an access by the Generic Connection Framework.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a list of MMAPI methods which can throw a SecurityException for non-media related security violations.
      They can potentially have other than media recording security policies attached to them.
    </p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=0>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b>&nbsp;API call</b>
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  &nbsp;<code>Manager.createPlayer(String locator)</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>Manager.createPlayer(InputStream stream, String type)</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>Manager.createPlayer(DataSource source)</code> <br>
	  <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>Player.realize()</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>Player.prefetch()</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>Player.start()</code> <br>
	  <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>DataSource.start()</code> <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>DataSource.connect()</code> <br>
	  <br>
	  &nbsp;<code>RecordControl.setRecordLocation(String locator)</code> <br>
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      When playback is started one of the methods Manager.createPlayer, Player.realize, Player.prefetch and Player.start
      must throw the SecurityException if there's no permission to open the connection. Because of the multi-stage
      initialization of Players it is not possible to
      specify which method exactly must do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that  <code>RecordControl.setRecordLocation</code> method also has a security permission
      for media recording. Therefore, it is possible that this method call can result in two separate
      security checks.
