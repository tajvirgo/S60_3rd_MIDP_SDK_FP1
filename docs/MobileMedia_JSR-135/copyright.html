<p style="margin-bottom: 0.13cm;">Specification Lead hereby grants you
a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited
license (without the right to sublicense), under the Specification
Lead's applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, use
and reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal
evaluation, which shall be understood to include developing applications
intended to run on an implementation of the Specification provided that
such applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of the
Specification. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.13cm;">Specification Lead also grants you a
perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free,
limited license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable
copyrights or patent rights it may have in the Specification to create
and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the Specification
that: (i) fully implements the Spec(s) including all its required
interfaces and functionality; (ii) does not modify, subset, superset or
otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or
protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within
the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the
Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (iii) passes the
TCK (including satisfying the requirements of the applicable TCK Users

previous paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass

licensees to make any claims concerning their implementation's
compliance with the Spec in question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">For the purposes of this Agreement: "<i>Independent

license from Specification Lead, includes any of Specification Lead's
source code or binary code materials; and "<i>Licensor Name Space</i>"
shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin
with "java", "javax", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent
naming convention adopted by <font color="#000000">Specification Lead </font>through
the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or
replacements thereof.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">This Agreement will terminate
immediately without notice from Specification Lead if you fail to comply
with any material provision of or act outside the scope of the licenses
granted above.</p>
